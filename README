Status

See the STATUS file for status information.

Compiling / Installing
----------------------

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions.

Using
-----

Just to be safe, you should backup all your data before using ZFS-FUSE.

1) Run zfs-fuse

This will start the main zfs-fuse daemon process that must be running
at all times.
You should be running it with root permissions.

Currently zfs-fuse can use between 16 and 128 MB of RAM, but it can
grow larger with some usage patterns.

2) Use the zpool and zfs commands to manage pools and filesystems.

You can learn about these commands at the OpenSolaris ZFS community
site: http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/

If you find a bug, please report it. See the BUGS file for instructions.
